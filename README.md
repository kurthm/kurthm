## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- Iâ€™m currently working on a model predicting wins in professional hockey
- I have experience working with data of many sports including volleyball and golf, but my main focus is hockey
- I am currently learning to code everything I know in R using Python
- I would love to learn more about baseball analytics and individual player evaluation methods
