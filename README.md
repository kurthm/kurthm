## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- I have experience working with data of many sports including volleyball and golf, but my main focus is hockey
- Iâ€™m currently working on a model predicting wins in professional hockey
- Other current projects include an NBA draft analysis and the NFL Big Data Bowl
- I am also learning to translate my work in R to Python
- I would love to learn more about baseball analytics and individual player evaluation methods
