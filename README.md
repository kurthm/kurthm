## Hi there 👋


- I have experience working with data of many sports including volleyball and golf, but my main focus is hockey
- I’m currently working on a model predicting wins in professional hockey
- I am also learning to code everything I know in R using Python
- I would love to learn more about baseball analytics and individual player evaluation methods
- I picked Kansas to win March Madness in 2022 and have been out in the first round since
